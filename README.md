## Problem to solve
You should create a simple application that shows metadata for episodes and podcasts. The app should cointain the following:
1. Two lists, one with podcasts and one with episodes. 
2. A landing page for a podcast
3. A landing page for an episode

The landing pages should be shown when the user clicks on a list item.

### Metadata 
#### List items
A podcast item needs to have:
- Title
- A part of the desciption
- The number of episodes

An episode item needs to have:
- Title
- A part of the desciption
- The length of the episode
- The date when the episode was created

#### Podcast landing page
It needs to have:
- Title
- The full description
- The number of episodes

#### Episode landing page
It needs to have:
- Title
- The name of the podcast
- The full description
- The length of the episode
- The date when the episode was created
